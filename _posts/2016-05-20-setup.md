Let's build a basic Alambic server from scratch.

## Server Requirements

To use Alambic make sure that your server meets the following requirements:

* PHP >= 5.5.x

## Package Installation

The recommended way to install this package, is through composer.

~~~bash
composer require webtales/alambic
~~~

## Create data files

Before creating our Alambic server, we need some data to query.
Our data will consist of two json files: Users and Posts.

>**Users.json**: our users datasource

~~~json
{
  "1" : {
    "id" : 1,
    "name" : "Luke"
  },
  "2" : {
    "id" : 1,
    "name" : "Anakin"
  }
}
~~~

>**Posts.json** : posts written by users

~~~json
{
  "1" : {
    "id" : 1,
    "text" : "May the Force be with you",
    "author" : 1
  },
  "2" : {
    "id" : 1,
    "text" : "I am your father",
    "author" : 2
  }
}
~~~

Once Alambic is installed and our basic data source is set, we can now configure your [First Data Model](http://webtales.github.io/alambic/start/data).
