Let's build a basic Alambic server from scratch.

## Server Requirements

To use Alambic make sure that your server meets the following requirements:

* PHP >= 5.5.x

## Package Installation

The recommended way to install this package, is through composer.

If you have not yet installed Composer, refer to this [documentation](https://getcomposer.org/doc/00-intro.md#installation-linux-unix-osx).

To start using Alambic in your project, you need to create a composer.json file that describes where to fetch the Alambic library.

{% gist 2d04ef8b8091152fc2e1fe6b31c2099d %}

After creating composer.json you can install the Alambic running:

~~~bash
php composer.phar install
~~~

Alambic and its dependancies should now be downloaded in the /vendor directory.

## Create data files

Before creating our Alambic server, we need some data to query.
Our data will consist of two json files: Users and Posts.
Create the following files in a /data directory.

{% gist 9eaf8be684f87df2f4a2bb1b2f8fcadb %}

{% gist 00fceda862b9301bc8330a32b7ecc867 %}

Once Alambic is installed and our basic data source is set, we can now configure your [First Data Model](http://webtales.github.io/alambic/start/model).
