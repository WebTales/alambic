Let's build a basic Alambic server from scratch.

## Server Requirements

To use Alambic make sure that your server meets the following requirements:

* PHP >= 5.5.x

## Package Installation

The recommended way to install this package, is through composer.

If you have not yet installed Composer, refer to this [documentation](https://getcomposer.org/doc/00-intro.md#installation-linux-unix-osx).

To start using Alambic in your project, you need to create a composer.json file that describes where to fetch the Alambic library.

>**composer.json**

~~~bash
{
    "require": {
        "webtales/alambic":"dev-master"
    }
}
~~~

After creating composer.json you can install the Alambic running:

~~~bash
php composer.phar install
~~~

Alambic and its dependancies should now be downloaded in the /vendor directory.

## Create data files

Before creating our Alambic server, we need some data to query.
Our data will consist of two json files: Users and Posts.

>**Users.json**: our users datasource

~~~json
{
  "1" : {
    "id" : 1,
    "name" : "Luke"
  },
  "2" : {
    "id" : 1,
    "name" : "Dark Vador"
  }
}
~~~

>**Posts.json** : posts written by users

~~~json
{
  "1" : {
    "id" : 1,
    "text" : "May the Force be with you",
    "author" : 1
  },
  "2" : {
    "id" : 2,
    "text" : "I am your father",
    "author" : 2
  }
}
~~~

Once Alambic is installed and our basic data source is set, we can now configure your [First Data Model](http://webtales.github.io/alambic/start/model).
