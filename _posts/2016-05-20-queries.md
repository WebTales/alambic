## Queries

Alambic is fully compliant with the [facebook/graphql specification](https://github.com/facebook/graphql).
A GraphQL query is a string interpreted by a server that returns data in a specified format.

Here is an example query we can make against our schema:

>Give me the field "name" from the user with id "1"

~~~code
{
  user(id: "1") {
    name
  }
}
~~~

The server should respond with:

~~~json
{
  "data": {
    "user": {
      "name": "Luke"
    }
  }
}
~~~

Another more complex query:

>Give me the list of users names along with their posts

~~~code
{
  users {
    name
    posts {
      text
    }
  }
}
~~~

The server should respond with:

~~~json
{
  "data": {
    "users": [
      {
        "name": "Luke",
        "posts": [
          {
            "text": "May the force be with you"
          }
        ]        
      },
      {
        "name": "Dark Vador",
        "posts": [
          {
            "text": "I am your father"
          }
        ]         
      }
    ]
  }
}
~~~

## Create an HTTP endpoint

We're almost finished. In order to query your Alambic server we now need to create an endpoint.

Alambic is "transport-agnostic", meaning that we could grab data over HTTP like normal or request data via a non-HTTP wire protocol.

For this example, we will simply expose our Alambic server over a single HTTP endpoint with these few (naive) lines of code:

~~~php
<?php
use Alambic\Alambic;
use \Exception;

// Get query string from url
$requestString = isset($_GET['query']) ? $_GET['query'] : null;

// Copy the configuration from the previous step here
$connectors = [ ... ];
$userModel  = [ ... ];
$postsModel = [ ... ];  

// Create an Alambic instance from configuration
$alambicConfig=[
  "alambicConnectors" => $connectors,
  "alambicTypeDefs" => [
    "User" => $userModel,
    "Post" => $postModel
  ]
];
$alambic = new Alambic($alambicConfig);

// Get results
$result = $alambic->execute($requestString,$variableValues,$operationName);

// Display results
header('Content-Type: application/json');
echo json_encode($result);
~~~

Be sure to get the right *$alambicConfig* var into your code, as detailed in the previous [configuration step](http://webtales.github.io/alambic/start/model).

You can now send your requests to your server via a GET request with a URL query string:

* http://localhost/query={user(id:"1"){name}}
* http://localhost/query={users{name posts {text}}}

Congratulations! You've set up your first GraphQL Alambic server.

There's plenty of resources to explore from now:

* [datasources](http://webtales.github.io/alambic/data-sources) to use real databases (MySQL, MongoDB, ...) instead of json files
* [middlewares](http://webtales.github.io/alambic/middlewares) if you want to add application logic and cool features like caching, versionning,... and so more
