At the heart of any GraphQL implementation is a description of what types of objects it can return, described in a GraphQL type system and returned in the GraphQL Schema.

## Internal Object Types

Alambic provides 5 internal types that can be used to compose your own custom type definition:

* String
* Int
* Float
* Boolean
* ID

## Custom Object Types

Every object field that compose your custom Type must belongs to one of internal or custom types:

~~~json
{
  "Product": {
    "fields": {
      "productId": {
        "type": "ID",
        ...
      },
      "Name": {
        "type": "String",
        ...      
      },
      "Price": {
        "type": "Float",
        ...      
      },
      "Weight": {
        "type": "Int",
        ...      
      },
      "InStock": {
        "type": "Boolean",
        ...      
      },
      "Stores": {
        "type": "Store",
        ...          
      }
    }
  }
}
~~~

## Fields

Fields are part of Object Types definitions.

They are described by the following options:

| Property | Type | Required | Description |
|----------|------|-----------------------|
| name | String | No | Name of the field. If not set GraphQL will use the key of fields array |
| type | Type | Yes | Must be an Internal Type or an existing foreign object Type |
| description | String | No | Field description for clients |
| required | Boolean | No | Is this field required? default to false |
| multivalued | Boolean | No | Is this field multivalued? default to false |
| args | Array | No | The args array is usually used to describe the fields that can be retrieved from a foreign object Type |
| relation | Key:Value | No | Describes the relation between the current and the foreign object Type. Key = foreign key name; Value = local key Name. |
