## Use Alambic

You can use Alambic by simply adding the following statement to your PHP scripts.

~~~php
<?php
use Alambic\Alambic;
~~~

## Create a basic Model

The Alambic configuration describes:

* the data structure: *Types*
* how data can be fetched: *Connectors*

### Setup connectors list

For this simple example, we will just use one of the built-in connectors: the *Json* connector, which map your types to json files.
One key strength of Alambic is that a single API endpoint can handle multiple connectors.

{% gist 7cd60efde60da60b7f69041bcd8337ba %}

### Setup types

*Types* describe the objects than can be requested, and the relations between theses objects

We'll first configure the Users model with its native fields ("id" and "name") and a new field "posts" as we would like to be able to retrieve a user and his posts in one single request.

{% gist 622e5d41d647f9da6d0fda568a76dca7 %}

The Post model is pretty similar to the User one.

## Create an Alambic instance

We can now merge connectors and models into one configuration array to configure an Alambic instance:

{% gist a3432a0219d56de8a7ee3bef87158f32 %}

Our alambic server is almost complete, we just need to [create a  request endpoint](http://webtales.github.io/alambic/start/queries) to be able to request it.
