## Create a basic Model

Before using Alambic we need to create a basic configuration to describe:

* the data structure: *Types*
* how data can be fetched: *Connectors*

Models can be constructed as PHP arrays or directly loaded from Json configuration files.

>Create the following directories for storing config files

- /schema
- /schema/connectors
- /schema/models

### Setup connectors list

For this simple example, we will just use one of the built-in connectors: the *Json* connector, which map your types to json files.
One key strength of Alambic is that a single API endpoint can handle multiple connectors.

>Create the files.json file in /schema/connectors

### Setup types

*Types* describe the objects than can be requested, and the relations between theses objects

We'll first configure the Users model.

>Create the users.json file in /schema/models

{% gist fa3cc989e17271aede775f9c7b7fa8e3 %}

The following table describes the main properties of the users model:

| Property | Type | Description |
|----------|------|-----------------------|
| name | String | Model name |
| description | String | Model description |
| fields | Array | The user model exposes its native fields ("id" and "name") and a new field "posts" as we would like to be able to retrieve a user along with his posts in one single request. Alambic can handle multiple types of relations between models (has one, has many, embeds one, embeds many, ...) even through multiple datasources |
| singleEndpoint | String | The single endpoint "user" allows to request for one user at a time, based on the user id |
| multiEndpoint | String  | The multi endpoint "users" allows to request a list of users |
| connector | Object | We will use the simple connector that we setup previously to fetch/write the users data in the users.json file |

The Post model is pretty similar to the User one.

>Create the posts.json file in /schema/models

## Create an Alambic instance

Our alambic configuration is now complete, we just need to [create a  request endpoint](http://webtales.github.io/alambic/start/queries) to be able to request it.
