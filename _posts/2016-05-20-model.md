## Use Alambic

You can use Alambic by simply adding the following statement to your PHP scripts.

~~~php
<?php
use Alambic\Alambic;
~~~

## Create a basic Model

The Alambic configuration describes:

* the data structure: *Types*
* how data can be fetched: *Connectors*

### Setup connectors list

For this simple example, we will just use one of the built-in connectors: the *Json* connector, which map your types to json files.
One key strength of Alambic is that a single API endpoint can handle multiple connectors.

~~~php
<?php
$connectors = [
  "mySimpleDB" => [
    "connectorClass" => "Alambic\Connector\Json",
    "basePath" => "./"
  ]
];
~~~

### Setup types

*Types* describe the objects than can be requested, and the relations between theses objects

We'll first configure the Users model with its native fields ("id" and "name") and a new field "posts" as we would like to be able to retrieve a user and his posts in one single request.

~~~php
<?php
$userModel = [
  // Use a unique model name
  "name" => "User",
  // Whatever model description you want
  "description" => "Writers",
  // Fields list
  "fields" => [
    // The 'id' field
    "id" => [
      "type" => "String",
      "required" => true,
      "description" => "User Id"
    ],
    // The 'name' field
    "name" => [
      "type" => "String",
      "description" => "User Name"
    ],
    // We add a relational field stored in another type
    "posts" => [
      "type" => "Post",
      // The relation can be hasOne or hasMany like here
      "multivalued" => true,
      // We can only query the text of the post
      "args" => [
        "text" => [
          "type"=> "String"
        ]
      ],
      // The foreign key is the "author" field in the Post type
      "relation" => [
        "author" => "id"
      ]
    ]
  ],
  // Can we query this model directly?
  "expose" => true,
  // The single endpoint allows to request for one user at a time
  "singleEndpoint" => [
    "name" => "user",
    // This endpoint only takes a user Id as an argument
    "args" => [
      "id" => [
        "type" => "String",
        "required" => true,
        "description" => "User Id"
      ]
    ]
  ],
  // The multi endpoint allows to request a list of users
  "multiEndpoint" => [
    "name" => "users"
  ],
  // The connector used to fetch/write the data
  "connector" => [
    "type" => "mySimpleDB",
    "configs" => [
      "fileName" => "users.json"
    ]
  ]
];
~~~

The Post model is pretty similar to the User one.

~~~php
<?php
$postModel = [
  "name" => "Post",
  "description" => "Blog Posts",
  "fields" => [
    "id" => [
      "type" => "String",
      "required" => true,
      "description" => "Post Id"
    ],
    "text" => [
      "type" => "String",
      "description" => "Post Text"
    ],
    "author" => [
      "type" => "String",
      "description" => "Author Id"
    ]
  ],
  "expose" => true,
  "singleEndpoint" => [
    "name" => "post",
    "args" => [
      "id" => [
        "type" => "String",
        "required" => true,
        "description" => "Post Id"
      ]
    ]
  ],
  "multiEndpoint" => [
    "name" => "posts"
  ],
  "connector" => [
    "type" => "mySimpleDB",
    "configs" => [
      "fileName" => "posts.json"
    ]
  ]
];
~~~

## Create an Alambic instance

We can now merge connectors and models into one configuration array to configure an Alambic instance:

~~~php
<?php
$alambicConfig=[
  "alambicConnectors" => $connectors,
  "alambicTypeDefs" => [
    "User" => $userModel,
    "Post" => $postModel
  ]
];
$alambic = new Alambic($alambicConfig);
~~~

Our alambic server is almost complete, we just need to [create a  request endpoint](http://webtales.github.io/alambic/start/queries) to be able to request it.
